# HackCMU2023
***
Our project is a simple yet elegent game which is intended to educated and entertain people on the urgent yet obscure issue of 
Space Debris being trapped in our orbit and limited potential space travel. 

Space Debris is a huge issue according to reputable sources such as NASA and we as a society need to start becoming more aware 
of this issue and frame our problem solving around being counciencious of this problem. This will not only reduce future space 
debris being released but also create a culture of more urgency on this debilitating problem, allowing future space travel for
centuries to come. 

Our game will do this by educating people on it and taking the first small step for man, one large step for humanity. 

You're welcome.
